# CarNotifierTweeter


This program requires the twitter gem, for twitter functionality. 

to install: `gem install twitter`

To choose the model for the car you want, you need to get the SelectedEntity from the URL and add the filters you want as well
(I reccommend doing each filter individually so it shows in the URL and then you know what to put in the filters)



A ruby program to alert about new listings from CarGurus and tweet to the user

I'm looking at cars to buy, and I don't want to constantly check...so here a program to do it from www.cargurus.com

Just edit it to your needs to make it run



Big thanks to StackOverflow user [Joshua Cheek](https://stackoverflow.com/users/184212/joshua-cheek) for his help with filter information
